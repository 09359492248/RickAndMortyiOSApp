// MARK: - Step6 -
// Now what we make an API call instaed of having to pass in the Raw data it'd be nice if we can define a native type to build up out a request. So that brings us to the next file we'll create here which will be a RMRequest.

// MARK: - Step8 -
/// Object that represents a single API call
final class RMRequest {
    // This is going to represent a single request right so whatever request we send to this API it should encapsulate all the data things along the lines of you know what endpoint do we want do we have any additional path components for the URL etc...
